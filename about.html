<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>We are a small travel business that provides holidays to different 
places at fair prices.Holidays can be booked for any specific time upto
a month since we are a small business. We thrive to have customers from 
all over the continent and our office is based in the area that is just 
a few miles from the center of the capital. </p>

<h3>How We Operate</h3>

<p> You may have a look at the Holiday Packages page of this site and book 
your destination by filling in the form on the Book A Holiday page.
We then send you an email asking for a confirmation of your booking, payment 
and then email you a ticket.
The ticket we send you has all the necessary details for you to show when 
checking in at the airport and at the hotel.</p>

<h4>Travel And Accomodation</h4>

<p>Our prices are rather fair which cover the accomodation and travel costs
altogether. So the price of a holiday package to wherever you are going 
includes the cost of your travel tickets(plain, train, car hire) and the 
accomodationwhere you will be staying. The ticket options available to you 
might be one-way and return.</p>

<h4>What We Have For You</h4>

<p>We might have for you descriptions of the available places you may like to 
visit. There is a table of the holiday packages for each of these places
which shows the ticket type(standard,first class, economy), Day Price(which 
is VAT Free),the type of transport you will use and a Ref.no for the package
on the Holiday Packages page.
<br>
A form which you can fill in to book your holiday is on the Book A Holiday
page. There might also be a separate Contact Us page if you would like or need
to contact us about this service. The Related Links page might give a list of 
links to websites that are related this service and may be helpful to you.</p>
